# 3D Printing

## RCH

My first experience with 3D printing was at The Royal Children’s Hospital, while my daughter Tiana was hospitalised following her stroke. During our stay, I occasionally visited the Spiritual Care centre, where I met Paul, the coordinator. Paul is a 3D printing enthusiast, and his office was decorated with an assortment of sensory toys, lithophanes of his family and other items that he had 3D printed himself. When I introduced Tiana to him, he kindly gave her an articulating crystal dragon. I couldn’t figure out how it had been assembled, until Paul explained how the nature of additive 3D printing in layers from the bottom up allows for the creation of permanently interlocked pieces - something difficult to achieve using traditional manufacturing methods. I was intrigued by the possibilities.

Music has always been important to Tiana. My mother-in-law is a piano teacher, and has been teaching Tiana online from Japan for years. Tiana had also been playing violin since grade 2 with her violin teacher Hilary. We were fortunate to be involved in the music therapy program at RCH, and Tiana always looked forward to her twice-weekly sessions. Her music therapist Jo even allowed us to borrow a keyboard so Tiana could play anytime in her room. Although I had to help by playing the left hand parts for her, it meant so much for her to be able to continue with it during her stay.

The music therapy room was full of instruments for us to try, including a banana keyboard. Having such a variety of instruments available was great in getting Tiana to start using her left hand again to create music.

Although Tiana was able to walk after a few months, it is often hardest to recover movement in the fingers of the affected side following a stroke. So we had no idea whether she would ever be able to play or even hold the violin again, with the amount of strength and dexterity required in the fingers of the left hand. 

## Violin

While scrolling through FaceBook, I was lucky to learn of the Adaptive Music Bridging Program (AMBP) run by Dr Anthea Skinner, a collaborative research project of the University of Melbourne and Melbourne Youth Orchestras. Tiana was accepted into the program, which kicked off with a Come & Try Day in early 2023. 

Tiana had the chance to try a range instruments, from a glockenspiel to a euphonium, selected as they could be played one-handed. Although she had a great time trying them out, her own violin was the only ensemble instrument that she wanted to play. So, we decided that day to get the strings and bridge on her violin reversed so she could use her unaffected right hand for fingering, while using her weaker left hand for bowing. We knew that it wouldn't be easy for her to control the angle, direction, speed and pressure of the bow, but we knew that if she had the will to do it, she could make it happen. We organised to get the string and bridge reversal done and then planned another session to figure out any other modifications we might need.

## Setbacks

Just days before that session, Tiana took a fall down a flight of steps. She ended up with a fracture in her upper left arm, a large bump on her forehead, and bruises all over her body. With Tiana's left side weakness, she has an increased risk of falls, and when it does happen, she is not able to react as well as normal to protect herself from serious injury. We were lucky that the fracture was the worst of her injuries, but with her arm immobilised for a month, it was a huge blow to her plans to resume playing violin.

Her arm recovered well, and when the wait was finally over, we finally had that session where we put together the rest of her violin modifications. A red piece of foam tubing became her bow grip, combined with a green silicone EazyHold strap that went over the back of her hand, allowed her to keep hold of her bow. A pencil, which we later swapped with a chopstick for a cleaner look, was attached to her violin to help keep the bow in the correct position by supporting some of its weight.

Even with these modifications, the reversed violin was now an entirely different instrument to what she'd played before her stroke. She needed to learn everything all over again. In addition, Tiana's affected arm would tire immediately, and she would have to rest after playing for less than a minute. We were also unable to find a reversed chin rest and shoulder rest to suit her 1/2 size violin. Despite the discomfort caused by ill-fitting equipment, she resumed lessons with her long-time violin teacher Hilary, commenced ensemble sessions with the AMBP, and kept practising at home, gradually building her strength and skill until she could keep up with the rest of her group at the AMBP.

## A need for 3D printing

When we signed Tiana up for the program, we had no idea what to expect. Even with the help of the program, we had feared that Tiana would find it too hard and give up at some point. Tiana surprised all of us with how quickly she was progressing, but we knew that her equipment was holding her back.
