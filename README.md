# 3D Printing

## RCH

My first experience with 3D printing was at The Royal Children’s Hospital, while my daughter Tiana was hospitalised following her stroke. During our stay, I occasionally visited the Spiritual Care centre, where I met Paul, the coordinator. Paul is a 3D printing enthusiast, and his office was decorated with an assortment of sensory toys, lithophanes of his family and other items that he had 3D printed himself. When I introduced Tiana to him, he kindly gave her an articulating crystal dragon. I couldn’t figure out how it had been assembled, until Paul explained how the nature of additive 3D printing in layers from the bottom up allows for the creation of permanently interlocked pieces - something difficult to achieve using traditional manufacturing methods. I was intrigued by the possibilities.

Music has always been important to Tiana. My mother-in-law is a piano teacher, and has been teaching Tiana online from Japan for years. Tiana had also been playing violin since grade 2 with her violin teacher Hilary. We were fortunate to be involved in the music therapy program at RCH, and Tiana always looked forward to her twice-weekly sessions. Her music therapist Jo even allowed us to borrow a keyboard so Tiana could play anytime in her room. Although I had to help by playing the left hand parts for her, it meant so much for her to be able to continue with it during her stay.

The music therapy room was full of instruments for us to try, including a banana keyboard. Having such a variety of instruments available was great in getting Tiana to start using her left hand again to create music.

Although Tiana was able to walk after a few months, it is often hardest to recover movement in the fingers of the affected side following a stroke. So we had no idea whether she would ever be able to play or even hold the violin again, with the amount of strength and dexterity required in the fingers of the left hand.

While scrolling through FaceBook, I was lucky to learn of the Adaptive Music Bridging Program run by Dr Anthea Skinner, a collaborative research project of the University of Melbourne and Melbourne Youth Orchestras. Tiana was accepted into the program, which kicked off with a Come & Try Day in early 2023.
